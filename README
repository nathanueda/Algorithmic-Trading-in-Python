Created three separate algorithmic trading prgorams in Python following a course created by Nick McCullum (https://nickmccullum.com/)

Utilized the IEX Cloud API for all three projects.

Project 1:
Equal-Weight S&P 500 Index Fund:
- Through utilizing batch API calls and various Python libraries (such as numpy and pandas) the program calculates the number of shares to buy based on a user-defined portfolio value of each S&P 500 constituent to get an equal-weighted version of the index fund.
- Exports the results utilizing xlsxwriter to a neatly formatted excel document.

Project 2:
Quantitative Momentum Strategy:
- Through utilizing batch API calls and various Python libraries (such as numpy and pandas) the program selects a list of the 50 highest quality momentum stocks based on various metrics such as varying time length price returns.
- The program calculates the number of shares to buy based on a user-defined portfolio amount.
- Exports the results utilizing xlsxwriter to a neatly formatted excel document.

Project 3:
Quantitative Value Strategy:
Quantitative Momentum Strategy:
- Through utilizing batch API calls and various Python libraries (such as numpy and pandas) the program selects a list of the 50 stocks with the best value metrics such as P/E ratio, P/B ratio, P/S ratio, etc.
- The program calculates the number of shares to buy based on a user-defined portfolio amount.
- Exports the results utilizing xlsxwriter to a neatly formatted excel document.
